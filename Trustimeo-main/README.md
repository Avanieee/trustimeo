git clone https://github.com/Artsuntkurian/Trustimeo.git
cd Trustimeo
```

### 🐍 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 📥 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🤖 4. Add the Model File

Download `best_vit_model.pth` and place it in:

```
app/model/best_vit_model.pth
```

## 💡 Model Details

- Architecture: `vit_large_patch16_224` from `timm`
- Trained for binary classification: `Real` (0) vs `Manipulated` (1)
- Preprocessing: Resizing to 224x224, Normalization (ImageNet stats)

---

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained using a combination of real and manipulated video/image data from public deepfake datasets:

- **FaceForensics++**: [https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)
- **DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC)**: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge)

### 📁 Dataset Format

- Videos were preprocessed into frames
- Frames labeled as:
  - `0 = Real`
  - `1 = Manipulated`
- Images resized to `224x224` and normalized using ImageNet stats
